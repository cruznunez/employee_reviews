# Employee Reviews

Objective: create two classes that will allow a user to add an employee to a given department. A user can give an employee information including name, phone number, email address, reviews, and salary. Every review is rated as good or bad and is stored with a date. You may also check if the database says the employee is performing satisfactorily based on their reviews. A user can also start a department and name it.

##Giving Raises

The user may also give a single employee a raise or give a whole department a raise. If the raise goes to the department, an optional block can be given, which would contain the condition required for the employee to meet the requirements for a raise. For example, maybe the user only wants to give a raise to workers who have 10 good reviews. The user should pass that condition as the block. If the user wants to give raises only for employees who earn under $50,000, they should make that the condition.
